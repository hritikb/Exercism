<h2 id="exception-messages">Exception messages</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.</p>
<p>To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
<code>raise Exception</code>, you should write:</p>
<p><code>python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")</code></p>
<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h2>
<p>To run the tests, run <code>pytest twelve_days_test.py</code></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module:
<code>python -m pytest twelve_days_test.py</code></p>
<h3 id="common-pytest-options">Common <code>pytest</code> options</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>-v</code> : enable verbose output</li>
<li><code>-x</code> : stop running tests on first failure</li>
<li><code>--ff</code> : run failures from previous test before running other test cases</li>
</ul>
<p>For other options, see <code>python -m pytest -h</code></p>
